## General info
This project is to control 5 servo motors using Arduino UNO R3 simulated with TINKERCAD circuit , The servo motor is used in robotics to activate movements, giving the arm to its precise angle , so we used it with several projects like robot arm , spider robot and  robotic vehicle .

### 1-servo motor rotate 90 degrees .
### 2-servo motor rotate 90 degrees and back to 0 degree after 3 sec .
### 3- Control multiple servo motors using Potentiometer
